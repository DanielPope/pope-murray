        <h1 class="pb-4">How George Met Evelyn</h1>
        <p>The meeting remains a mystery, but from the accounts of many who knew them, Evelyn, a slim figured beauty caught the eye of tall, smart and handsome George Pope and he won her heart. They were united in marriage on September 21, 1939 at the Church of the Living God the Pillar and Ground of the Truth in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by Prophet Frank F.S. Cherry, where they attended. Together they had ten children: Jonathan, Rachel (Jones), David, Solomon, Joshua, Samuel, Michael, Benjamin, Ruth Ann, and Timothy.</p>
        <p>George and Evelyn raised their children at their church, where George regularly shared his gifts as a musician, gospel singer, and teacher of Hebrew and Yiddish. Affluent in eight languages, he enjoyed learning all he could. Evelyn, a beloved wife, mother and homemaker, kept a beautiful home, enjoyed fashion, instilled biblical values in her children, and was an exceptional cook. In fact, anyone who visited the Pope home felt welcomed and was guaranteed to be well fed, and she was known for her Southern hospitality and green thumb. Together, George and Evelyn were quite the pair!
        <p>George was born in Saluda, SC on December 25, 1909 to Laddie and Anne Pope. He was the eldest of two younger brothers, John and Laddie. All gifted and talented, George was particularly artistic – excelling in music, languages, and calligraphy. He was seen on many occasions with his guitar in tow and accompanied many in the church with voice and guitar. Eventually, racial troubles led George to Philadelphia, where he worked various jobs and met the love of his life. Over the years he developed diabetes and succumbed to it on August 27, 1959 at the age of 50.</p>
        <p>Evelyn Murray was born in Walterboro, SC on December 27, 1915 to Joseph and Anna Murray.  She was one of seven children.  Her siblings were Martha (Douse), Julius, Lillian (Butler), Luther, Albertha, Mary Louise (Koger), and Herbert. She graduated high school at the Mather School for Girls in Beaufort, South Carolina — now The Technical College of The Low Country. [Ironically, her granddaughter Matteel had the privilege of working there as a Vice President.] Also incredibly talented in many areas, Evelyn was a spiritual person with a big heart for people. She was adept at sewing, cooking and many skills that pertain to living a well-rounded life. She moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to take care of her Aunt Ernestine White. Following her husband George’s passing, Evelyn had to become both mom and dad for her children. She was a strong, dedicated mother, whom her children affectionately called “Sis.”</p>
        <p>An old African proverb says, “A family tie is like a tree. It can bend but it cannot break.” A family tree is also known by the fruit it bears. As they say, ‘the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree.’ As George and Evelyn’s descendants, that couldn’t be more true for all of us. We each have their blood running through our veins and their gifts embedded in every fiber of our beings – everything from art, music, hospitality, education, fashion, culinary, gardening, numbers, computers, business, and the list goes on — an endless potpourri of exceptional spirit, gifts and talents!</p>
        <p>The <b>2022 Pope-Murray Family Reunion</b> will showcase and celebrate our lush history . . . a past to remember, a present to celebrate, and a future to generate!</p>
